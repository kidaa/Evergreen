Improved reporting of progress during purchase order activation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The progress dialog that is displayed when activating a purchase
order now displays more information, particularly during the asset
creation phase. It is now also updated in a more linear fashion;
making it less likely for it to appear that the activation has
stalled.
