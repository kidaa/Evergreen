Link in catalog to clear Added Content cache
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
On the catalog's record summary page, there is now a link for staff that
allow them to forcibly clear the cache for the Added Content for that
record. This is helpful for if the Added Content retrieved the wrong
cover jacket art, summary, etc. and caches the wrong result.
