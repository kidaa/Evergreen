SKOS for coded values
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Some vocabularies used (or which could be used) for stock
record attributes and coded value maps in Evergreen are
published on the web using SKOS. The record attributes system
can now associate Linked Data URIs with specific attribute
values. In particular, seed data supplying URIs for the
RDA Content Type, Media Type, and Carrier Type in this release.

This is an experimental, "under-the-hood" feature that will be built
upon in subsuquent releases.
