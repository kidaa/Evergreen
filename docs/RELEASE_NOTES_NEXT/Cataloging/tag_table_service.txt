MARC Tag-table Service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The tag tables for the web staff client MARC editor are
now stored in the database rather than a separate XML
tooltips file as used by the XUL MARC editor.  The tag-table
service, which is part of the web staff client sprint 2
preview in this release, has the following features:

- specifies whether (sub)fields are optional or mandatory
- specifies whether (sub)fields are repeatable or not
- a coded value map can be associated with a subfield to
  establish a controlled vocabulary for that subfield
- MARC field and subfield definitions can be overridden
  by institutions further down in the organizational unit
  hierarchy.  This allows, for example, a library to specify
  definitions for local MARC tags.
- values supplied by the tag-table service are used to
  populate values in context menus in the web staff client
  MARC editor.

The initial seed data for the in-database tag table is
derived from the current tooltips XML file.
