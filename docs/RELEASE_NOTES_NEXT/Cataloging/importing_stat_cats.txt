Importing Statistical Categories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can now retrieve statistical categories (stat cats) from the MARC
record and apply them to the items in Evergreen. When importing or
overlaying items through the Vandelay MARC batch import process, edit
your Holdings Import Profile to tell Evergreen which subfield contains
your stat cat data. That subfield in your MARC records should be
formatted like the following:

----
CATEGORY 1|VALUE 1||CATEGORY 2|VALUE 2
----

Notice that the pipe character '|' is used to separate each category
from its value, and two pipes separate each pair of category values.

If you are overlaying existing copies which already have stat cats
attached to them, the overlay process will keep those values unless the
incoming copies contain updated values for matching categories.
