Change to Available Copies Display
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The _Show_ link in the available copies area of the record summary will now
display for any org unit that owns a copy of a particular title, even if all
those copies are unavailable. The _Show_ link will not display if a) the copy
display is already scoped to that org unit or b) the org unit does not own
copies of the title. 

The language has also been changed to read "x of y copies available at z
library."
