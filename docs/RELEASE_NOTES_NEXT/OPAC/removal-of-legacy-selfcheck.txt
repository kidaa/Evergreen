The legacy selfcheck interface is no longer included in Evergreen as
of this release.

This interface was formerly located at a URL ending in
extras/selfcheck/selfcheck.xml

No attempt is made at upgrade time to automatically remove this
interface.

It is recommended that you remove this interface and its associated
configuration after performing an upgrade:

- opac/extras/selfcheck/selfcheck.js
- opac/extras/selfcheck/selfcheck.xml
