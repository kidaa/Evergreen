Column sorting in circulation screens
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sorting of selected columns is now available in the *Items Checked Out*, *Check Out History*,
and *Holds* screen.

* Clicking on the appropriate column heads now sorts the contents from
``ascending'' to ``descending'' to ``no sort''.  (The ``no sort'' restores the
original list as presented in the screen.)

* The sort indicator (an up or down arrow) is placed to the right
of the column head, as appropriate.

* The combined *Title/Author* column in the *Items Checked Out* screen is now separated into two
independently sortable columns (Title and Author).

* Title sorting is done with the so-called `filing' characters (leading ``the'', ``a'',
``an'', and other langugage equivalents) removed. The leading articles are rendered in
a smaller font, so as to keep the main entry prominent.  In
addition to the filing characters removed for the sort, leading
non-alphanumeric characters are ignored in the sort.
