New bib source variable for catalog customization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For bibliographic records, there is a "bib source" that can be
associated with every record. This source is now available as a
variable that can be used behind the scenes when customizing
the online catalog. The new bib source variables do not present
themselves in the catalog display by default.
