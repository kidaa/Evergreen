Removal of deprecated "JSPAC" interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The deprecated Javascript OPAC interface known as "JSPAC" is no
longer included in Evergreen as of this release.

With the understanding that local sites may have made use of
existing parts of the old JSPAC interface -- especially images and
CSS -- no attempt is made at upgrade time to automatically remove
the existing files from disk.

When upgrading, you may wish to remove "index.xml" from your Apache
DirectoryIndex directives.

The following directories, xml, js, and css files were formerly part
of JSPAC, and you may be able to safely remove them from your system
after verifying that they and their contents are no longer required:

- web/opac/common/css/
- web/opac/common/js/dtree.js
- web/opac/common/xml/
- web/opac/extras/bbags.js
- web/opac/extras/bbags.xml
- web/opac/skin/default/js/
- web/opac/skin/default/xml/
- web/opac/theme/

The list of images removed in this change is lengthy, and not
included here.
