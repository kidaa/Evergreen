Pre-Expiration A/T Event Definition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A new Action Trigger event definition ("30 Day Account Expiration Courtesy 
Notice") for sending alerts to users before their accounts are expired has 
been added.  This is intended to give users time to renew their account before 
they lose access to library services.
